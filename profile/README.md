Welcome to the central repository for the **TechTorque 2025** project.

This project is a modern, enterprise-grade web application designed to digitize and streamline the operations of an automobile service company.

## 🏛️ System Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](Architecture.png)

The project is built on a **polyglot microservices architecture**. This design provides scalability, resilience, and technological flexibility, allowing each component to use the best tool for its specific job.

- **💻 Frontend Web App:** A [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and TypeScript application serving both customers and employees.
- **🌐 API Gateway:** A single entry point written in Go, responsible for routing, authentication (JWT validation), and rate limiting.
- **⚙️ Backend Microservices:** A suite of independent [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) services, each with its own dedicated PostgreSQL database, handling specific business domains.
- **🗄️ Databases:** A mix of [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for transactional data and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for semi-structured data like notifications and chat logs.

> ⚠️ Note: this project deploys to a lightweight Kubernetes distribution — **k3s** — in development and staging. The `k8s-config` repository contains manifests compatible with k3s. See `KUBERNETES_SETUP.md` and `ARGOCD_SETUP_SUMMARY.md` for details on k3s and ArgoCD setup.

For a complete architectural overview, please see the `EAD TechTorque.pdf` design document.

## 🚀 Getting Started: The All-in-One Development Environment

The entire TechTorque ecosystem is orchestrated using Docker Compose. This allows any developer to build and run all containers with a single command.

### ✅ Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) & [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- A Java 17+ JDK
- Node.js & npm
- Go language

### ▶️ Running the Full System

1. **Clone this repository.**
2. **Navigate to the project root** (where this `README.md` and `docker-compose.yml` are located).
3. **Run the Docker Compose command:**

```bash
# To start all services and watch for code changes (recommended for development)
docker-compose watch
```

or

```bash
# To start all services in the background without hot-reloading
docker-compose up --build -d
```

This command will build, create, and start all containers.

### Development notes

- Use environment overrides in `k8s-config` and `docker-compose.override.yml` for local secrets. Avoid committing secrets to the repository.
- The `docker-compose watch` task is a development helper; it enables hot reload for code changes in the local environment. If you don't have it, use `docker-compose up --build -d`.

### Accessing the System

- **API Gateway:** `http://localhost:8080`
- **Frontend Application:** `http://localhost:3000` (after running `npm run dev` in the `Frontend_Web` directory)
- **Individual Service Docs:** `http://localhost:[PORT]/swagger-ui.html` (e.g., `http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui.html` for the Auth Service)

## 🧩 Repository Structure

Each major component of the system resides in its own top-level directory. Please refer to the `README.md` file within each directory for specific details about that service.

### Service Completion Status

### Contribution & PR flow

- Branching policy: use `dev` for work in progress and create feature branches named `feature/<ticket-number>-short-description`.
- Create a draft PR early for design discussions; add tests for new features and link related issues.
- CI: tests run on GitHub Actions. Ensure the relevant `buildtest.yaml` passes locally before opening a PR.
- Deploys are managed via ArgoCD. Use `GITOPS_PIPELINE_COMPLETE.md` for promotion steps.
